# alchitryau
This repository was created to kickstart the development with the Alchitry Au FPGA board, and its standard IO shield.
	The .xdc file contains the description of the IO pins, and basic instructions for their usage.
	The modules are for general purpose usage, and can be built into any project. (They use the previously described .xdc file.)
Enjoy!

Available modules:
	- 7 segment display driver with 4 hex digits
	- Binary to decimal converter
	- Î¼s counter (with 100 MHz clock)
